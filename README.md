## Moroccan Delights Menu
# Welcome to my first React project - "ATLAS OASIS BITES"!

## Overview
This project is a simple web application built with React, showcasing a delightful menu from a Moroccan restaurant. The aim is to demonstrate the use of React components, props, and JSX to create a dynamic and interactive user interface.

## Features
Component-Based Structure: The project follows a component-based architecture, organizing different aspects of the application into reusable and modular components.

Props for Dynamic Data: Utilizing props to pass dynamic data between components, each dish in the menu is represented as a separate component, allowing for easy scalability.

JSX for Declarative UI: The user interface is created using JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript recommended for building React applications. JSX provides a concise and expressive way to describe the structure of UI components.
